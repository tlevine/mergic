## Old stuff from tennis

To produce the test data from its source:

```bash
./data.sh
## currently 669 unique names in names_all.txt
```

To make the best-guess merge table:

```bash
cat names_all.txt | ./uno.py > names_uno.txt
```

It looks like the only problem is with the Plíšková twins. But Karolína played in the [2013 US Open](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_Singles), so we only have to edit data rows two and three. The result is in `names_merge.txt`.

How many unique players are there?

```bash
tail +2 names_merge.txt | cut -d, -f2 | sort | uniq | wc -l
# 359
```

So who played the most in these events?

```bash
join -t, <(sort names_all.txt) <(sort names_merge.txt) | cut -d, -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#  24 Novak Djokovic
#  22 Rafael Nadal
#  21 Serena Williams
#  21 David Ferrer
#  20 Na Li
#  19 Victoria Azarenka
#  19 Agnieszka Radwanska
#  18 Stanislas Wawrinka
#  17 Tommy Robredo
#  17 Sloane Stephens
```
